# osascript for Rebol and Red

Osascript executes AppleScripts and other OSA language scripts. Executes the given script file, or standard input if none is given. Scripts can be plain text or compiled scripts. osascript was designed for use with AppleScript, but will work with any Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) language. This binding is optimized for [Rebol](http://www.rebol.com) R3.
Actually I'm using [Oldes's Version](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3), since he developed a wonderfull [compiler](https://github.com/Siskin-framework/Builder) thats allows 32- and 64-bit executables for Intel and ARM processors.
Code is based on Ashley Truter's rebol 2 sample
[mac-requestors](http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=mac-requestors.r), and just adapted to be used with R3 or Red.

### Install and run
